First of all, you can see the available nested subcommands of a subcommand, the description and syntax of every subcommand in *cppack* by adding a `-h` or `--help` flag.

For initializing a new project, you can use the `cppack project init [type] [name]` subcommand. For more information about project creation and types, see [Projects](/doc/projects.md). If you wanna create a project which compiles to a runnable file, then run `cppack project init executable`, it will create a project with the name of the current directory in which the command was executed. To build it, run `cppack project build`. To run it, `cppack project run`.
